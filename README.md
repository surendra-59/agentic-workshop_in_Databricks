Learned how to build, enhance, and deploy AI systems by combining traditional machine learning with Generative AI on the Databricks Platform. This hands-on workshop shows how governed data, modern ML workflows, and GenAI capabilities come together to power secure, scalable AI innovation.

In this session, I get the chance to:

Learn how to utilize vector search within Databricks to enhance your Generative AI applications, making it easier to find and retrieve information based on similarity.

Get hands-on experience with embedding models to understand how data can be transformed into a format that generative models can use more effectively for tasks like recommendation systems or content generation.

Dive into the AI Playground on Databricks to experiment with foundational models, explore various AI functions, and see how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Understand how to pull open-source foundational models into your workflows, integrating them into experiments and pipelines for generating text, images, and more.
